## Chasing the clicks

Chasing the Clicks is a web page with a clickable button and a click count. Every time that the button is clicked, the number increases by 1. When the web page is refreshed, the click count number reflects all previous clicks. That means, refreshing the page does not reset the count to 0 or any other default number. Distribution of clicks is shown by geography.
